# Price-Elasticity
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) quantifies how much the quantity demanded of a product changes in response to price fluctuations. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. PED provides valuable insights for businesses, helping them gauge customer sensitivity to price changes and make strategic pricing decisions.

- Highly elastic demand (PED > 1): A small price decrease leads to a significant increase in sales, which could boost revenue.
- Inelastic demand (PED < 1): A business can raise prices with minimal effect on sales volume, improving profit margins.
